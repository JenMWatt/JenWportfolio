        <p>Hello there! I'm a junior react developer.
            <br>
            I'm new to the tech industry and I hope to make a name for myself!
            <br>
            I'm twospirit and I'm from Treaty number 1, Winnipeg, Manitoba.
            <br>
            I am 28 and with 10 months of front-end experience. I aspire to create applications and websites.
            <br>
            My family is very important to me. My siblings and my parents mean the world to me. They are the centre of my strength.
            <br>
            I spent the first 27 years of my life caring for my family.
            <br>
            I'm the technician of the house, I trouble shoot devices, internet, and I create online accounts for everyone.
            <br>
            <br>At their core, Jen has this fire. They dream for a world of peace and unity.
            <br>They believe, everyone has the power to learn. 
            <br>And they believe, that everyone in this world has a passion to show.
            <br>With their love of social activism mixed in with their love for their family,
            <br> they hope to use their new technical skills to bring a new positive change into the tech industry.
