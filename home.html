     <p>Hello there! I'm a junior react developer.
         <br>
         I'm new to the tech industry and I hope to make a name for myself!
         <br>
         I'm twospirit and I'm from Treaty number 1, Winnipeg, Manitoba.
         <br>
         I am 29 and with 11 months of front-end experience. I aspire to create applications and websites.
         <br>
         My family is very important to me. My siblings and my parents mean the world to me. They are the centre of my strength.
         <br>
         I spent the first 27 years of my life caring for my family.
         <br>
         I'm the technician of the house, I trouble shoot devices, internet, and I create online accounts for everyone.
         <br>
         <br>At their core, Jen has this fire. They dream for a world of peace and unity.
         <br>They believe, everyone has the power to learn. 
         <br>And they believe, that everyone in this world has a passion to show.
         <br>With their love of social activism mixed in with their love for their family,
         <br> they hope to use their new technical skills to bring a new positive change into the tech industry.
         
        </p>
